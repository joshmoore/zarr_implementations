Target(s):
  write                generate data for all implementations
  list                 print directory\tpath pairs for all written data
  read                 read all data written by all implementations
  read-fast            like read, but do not re-run `write`

Notes:
  - Each implementation has a conda environment named ZI_<IMPL>
